# UniversalMarkdownUWP
Universal Markdown UWP is a library to use on UWP apps. The package is already on [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UniversalMarkdownUWP.Managed/), and is based on the original UniversalMarkdown from Baconit app.

# How to use?
Is so simple, that is better if you look [here](https://github.com/QuinnDamerell/UniversalMarkdown/blob/develop/UniversalMarkdownTestApp/MainPage.xaml). You just need to add universalMarkdown XAML controls and of course, xmlns:universalMarkdown="using:UniversalMarkdown" namespace to XAML.
